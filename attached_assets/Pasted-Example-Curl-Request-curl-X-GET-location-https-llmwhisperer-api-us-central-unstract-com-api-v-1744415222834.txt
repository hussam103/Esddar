Confidence Metadata
The confidence metadata contains the confidence score for each line of text extracted from the document. For each line, an array of JSONs is provided with words and their confidence scores. Words with confidence of >= 0.9 are ignored. The confidence score is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high confidence and 0 indicates low confidence.

  # Each element represents confidence scores for a line
  confidence_metadata = [
    [],                             # Line 1 
    [],                             # Line 2
    [],                             # Line 3
    [],                             # Line 4
    [],                             # Line 5
    [],                             # Line 6
    [                               # Line 7
      {
        "confidence": "0.801",
        "text": "Please"
      },
      {
        "confidence": "0.852",
        "text": "find"
      }
    ],
    [                               # Line 8
      {
        "confidence": "0.767",
        "text": "payment"
      }
    ],
    [],                             # Line 9

In the above example, the confidence score for the words "Please" and "find" in line 7 is 0.801 and 0.852 respectively. The confidence score for the word "payment" in line 8 is 0.767.
